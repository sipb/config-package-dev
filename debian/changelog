config-package-dev (5.5) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Add Rules-Requires-Root: no to base package and examples, which
    should fix ci.debian.net tests.
  * Add Multi-Arch: foreign, which allows apt to resolve
    config-package-dev as a cross-build-dependency. Thanks to @mrksngl
    on GitHub for the patch.
  * Also add Multi-Arch: foreign to the examples, as this is right for most
    users of config-package-dev (just as Architecture: all is right for most
    users of config-package-dev).
  * displace.sh: Rename (un)displace_link_displace to
    (un)displace_link_divert (Debathena: #1362)
  * Switch to machine-readable debian/copyright.
  * Ensure installed examples are not compressed, so you can copy them
    and build them directly.

config-package-dev (5.3) unstable; urgency=high

  * Fix a regression in the change that permitted omission of leading

    version of lynx.
  * Update Standards-Version to 4.1.0 by changing priority from "extra"

  * Permit debian/$package.displace-extension to omit the leading dot
    (Closes: #760200). Thanks to Dima Kogan for the patch.
  * Allow Debhelper control files to omit leading slashes
    (Closes: #803962).
  * Allow specifying relative paths, within the Debian source package,
    as the source for a transformation, and do not check these files
    against the dpkg database (Closes: #864611). Thanks to Luca Boccassi
    for the patch.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 4.0.0 and Debhelper compat level to v9
    (no changes).
  * debian/control, debian/copyright: Use https in URLs.
  * debian/control: Depend on ${perl:Depends}, which gives us a
    dependency on perl (not just perl-base) for Digest::MD5. Thanks,
    dh_perl!

config-package-dev (5.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add Debhelper support (Debathena: #867) (Closes: #693672).  This
    release includes a new command, dh_configpackage, and a sequencer
    extension, dh --with config-package.
  * Use the terms "displace" and "hide" for actions of the
    config-package-dev system, instead of the terms "divert" and
    "remove", which already have existing (related) meanings in the
    context of Debian packages.
  * Move examples/* to examples/cdbs/*, and create examples/debhelper/*,
    with the same packages using Debhelper 7-style packaging.

  * Change config-package-dev's own packaging to Debhelper 7.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.4 (no changes required).
  * Update Vcs-Git and Vcs-Browser locations to new upstream.

    Build-Depending on CDBS, probably through use of the @cdbs@ macro in
    debian/control.in.

    work on modern systems.

    divert.sh (Debathena: #1061).
  * Undivert when a package is unconfigured, in addition to when it is
    removed (partially addresses Debathena #388).

    project mailing list.

    transformation. (Thanks to Patrick Hurst for writing decode).

  [ Anders Kaseorg ]
  * Fix a quoting bug that failed to disallow transformation of generated
    conffiles.  (Patch from Evan Broder.)
  * Remove DEB_UNDIVERT_VERSION_file and DEB_UNREMOVE_VERSION_file, and
    instead test for the undiverted file in the postinst.  (Patch from

    order when DH_COMPAT ≥ 5, to match debhelper’s behavior.
